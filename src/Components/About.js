              {" "}
              I have extensive experience in blockchain development for over 4
              years, specializing in platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger
              Fabric. On Ethereum, I have developed smart contracts using
              Solidity and integrated them with decentralized applications
              (DApps) using technologies like Web3.js for front-end interaction
              and Truffle for testing and deployment. This includes projects
              involving tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications,
              and supply chain transparency solutions.
            </p>
            <br />
            Additionally, my background as a senior full-stack developer for
            over 8 years equips me with a comprehensive understanding of both
            front-end and back-end development. I have successfully delivered
            scalable and efficient solutions using a wide range of technologies
            including JavaScript, Python(Django), PHP(Laravel), Node.js,
            React(Next), Vue(Nuxt), and SQL(MySQL)/NoSQL(MongoDB) databases.
            <br />
            This dual proficiency allows me to seamlessly integrate blockchain
            solutions with existing systems or develop standalone decentralized
            applications tailored to specific business needs.
